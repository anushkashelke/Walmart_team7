Domain: Fraud Detection 

Project Name: Fake Barcode Detection

We have built a GUI application that takes a product image/barcode image as input, scans the image, and generates a barcode.
If the decoded barcode is not present in the database, it will state that "Barcode is not registered in the database".
If a barcode is not at all generated from the image, it means that the image is not valid, further stating "No barcode found".

Tech Stacks:

Python,Google Colab,Streamlit


Python Libraries: pytesseract,pyzbar,cv2,numpy,PIL
